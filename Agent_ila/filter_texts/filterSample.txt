Example 1: One leaf filter with no boolean filter. The boolean component has a single value. The user query: "Show all the data Skade formation"

{"filter" : {'equals': {'property': [ILA_SPACE, ILA_CONTAINER_ID, 'container property'], formation:"Skade"}}}           

Example 2: One bolean filter with two leaf filters. The first leaf filter's component has two values inside a list. The second leaf filter has a single component value. The user query: "Give me the wells named '15-F-11 T2' and '15-F-1 C' and include only those with an average rate of penetration (ROP) greater than or equal to 20."

{"filter" : {'or': [{'containsAll': {'property': [ILA_SPACE, ILA_CONTAINER_ID, 'wellName'], 'values': ['15-F-11 T2'', '15-F-1 C']}}, {'range': {'property': [ILA_SPACE, ILA_CONTAINER_ID, 'averageROP'], 'gte': 20}}]}}

Example 3: Two filters for the formation property and the holeDepthMeasured. The user query: "Give me the data drilled in the Hugin formation from a depth range of 3232 to 3240."

{"filter": {"and": [{"equals": {"property": [ILA_SPACE, ILA_CONTAINER_ID, "formation"], "value": "Hugin"}}, {"range": {"property": [ILA_SPACE, ILA_CONTAINER_ID, "holeDepthMeasured"], "gte": 3232, "lte": 3240}}]}}
